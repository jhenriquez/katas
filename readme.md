# Katas #

This repository contains Katas, I've touched. Mostly coming from Codewars.

#### Okay, I only see a readme. Where are they?  ####

The way this works is with a branch by language :)

#### Anymore advice? ####

There will be languange specific information on the readme for every branch.

### JavaScript ###

Welcome to the JavaScript section.

This is essentially a NodeJS repository. So all you need to do is, install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/download/) and:

````npm install

That should get you up and ready.
